hostnamer
=========

A small bash script to easily change your hostname with Zenity GUI. It can even generate a random hostname for you.
Two versions are included, one day they could be merged together with a bash test if we know what system we're running on.
Script is in the Public Domain.

Installation
=========
* You will need a dictionary and Zenity.
* Copy scripts wherever you like, then make them executable via chmod +x.
* Run as sudo.

Use either of these scripts depending on your distro -
* hostnamer-arch.sh (Works on Arch, Archbang, Manjaro, Parabola GNU/Linux-libre, etc.)
* hostnamer-debian.sh (Works on Debian, Ubuntu, Trisquel, etc.)

* Enjoy!
