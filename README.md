hostnamer
=========

A small bash script to easily change your hostname with Zenity GUI. It can even generate a random hostname for you.
Two versions are included, one day they could be merged together with a bash test if we know what system we're running on.
Script is in the Public Domain. Enjoy!

* hostnamer-arch.sh (Works on Arch, Archbang, Manjaro, Parabola GNU/Linux-libre, etc.)
* hostnamer-debian.sh (Works on Debian, Ubuntu, Trisquel, etc.)
